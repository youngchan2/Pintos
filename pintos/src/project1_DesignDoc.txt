I use the given rw_semaphore & seqlock data structure. I didn't add or remove any variables.

1. Read/Write Semaphore
1.1 void rwsema_init(struct rw_semaphore *rwsema)
To initilaize read/write semaphore, reader count(rcount) should be zero and the writer should be null.
By using list_init function, initialize the list for read waiters and write waiters.

1.2 void down_write(struct rw_semaphore *rwsema)
To get the lock, disable the interrupt first.
To make the lock exclusive, set the condition to check whether the reader or the writer is exist.
If there are any readers or the writer exist, the thread should be pushed back to the writer waiter list and the thread should will be blocked.
When the thread pass this condition, the thread is safe to acquire the write lock.
Then recover the interrupt normally.

1.3 void down_read(struct rw_semaphore *rwsema)
Same as down_write fucntion, disable the interrupt first
Unlike writers, readers have a shared lock.
Since the multiple readers can acquire lock simultaneously, the only thing to check is the existence of writer.
If writer exists, the thread should be pushed back to the reader waiters list and be blocked.
When there is no writers, now the thread can acuqire read lock and increase the rcount variable.

1.4 void up_write(struct rw_semaphore *rwsema)
Same as down_write fucntion, disable the interrupt first
After release the exclusive lock, check whether the write waiter list is empty.
If there is a waiting writer, wake it up by using list_pop_front and thread_unblock function.
If the writer waiters list is empty, check whether the read waiter list is empty.
If there is a waiting reader, wake it up with same way as the waiting writer.

1.5 void up_read(struct rw_semaphore *rwsema)
Same as down_write fucntion, disable the interrupt first
After finish reading, first check the read waiters list.
If there is waiting reader, wake it up by using list_pop_front and thread_unblock function.
If there is no waiting readers, check whether the reader is last and write waiters list is empty.
If the reader is the last one and there is waiting writer, wake the waiting writer up by using list_pop_front and thread_unblock function.

2. Sequence Lock
2.1 void seqlock_init(struct seqlock *seqlock)
Same as read/write semaphore, initialize the sequence and writer as 0 and null.

2.2 int64_t read_seqlock_begin(struct seqlock *seqlock)
To compare the sequence number after finsihing the reading, first store the current sequence number.
So just return the sequence number in the seqlock argument.

2.3 bool read_seqretry(struct seqlock *seqlock, int64_t sequence)
This function is for check the sequence consistency after finsihing the reading.
So check the current sequence and compare to the past sequence.

2.4 void write_seqlock(struct seqlock *seqlock)
When the writer acuqire the lock, increase the sequence number.
While one writer is writing, other writers should be wait until the current writing is finsihed.
So check whether the writer is writing, and if so, the thread will be blocked.

2.5 void write_sequnlock(struct seqlock *seqlock)
After finishing the writing, increase the sequence number and release writer pointer as null.
So the other writer can acuqire the lock.

[Extra Credit]
I utilize atomic increment in the project slides.
For write_seqlock & write_sequnlock, they need not only increasing sequence number but also allocating writer.
Because of this reason, I add the allocation assembly code using movl instruction.
For write_seqlock, current thread will require lock so I set the source operand as thread_current and destination operand as writer.
For write_sequnlock, thread should release the lock so I set the source operand as constant 0 and destination operand as writer.

* atomic load: asm volatile("lock; movl %1, %0": "=r"(seq): "r"(seqlock->sequence): "memory");
Using movl instruction, set the source operand as the local variable which will be loaded by seqlock->sequence.
seqlock->sequence is located in memory so using "m" is proper but it raises kernel panic so I change it to "r".
I think the compiler approach to the mermoy and load the value to the register automatically.
For load, it doesn't do any operation in the memory so using "r" will be more safe to load the value in the memory.
